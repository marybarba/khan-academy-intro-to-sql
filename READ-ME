# khan-academy-intro-to-sql
This code repository contains coding challenges I completed while taking Khan Academy's "Intro to SQL: Querying and Managing Data" lesson.

In the Khan Academy lesson, "Intro to SQL: Querying and Managing Data", there were three code challenges to create different, basic databases to test my comprehension of what was being taught.
There was a final project at the end of the lesson on designing a store database that talked about pricing, inventory, and other store stats.

Here are the three challenges:
  Challenge: Book list database
  Challenge: Box office hits database
  Challenge: TODO list database stats
  Project: Design a store database
